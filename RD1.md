### Objective
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this lab we were supposed to create a program that would calculate the amount of times a number was
randomly rolled in a pair of die. The number of times the die were rolled was inputted by the user.

### Procedure
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. The first thing we did was create an algorithm. This helped us visualize how we wanted the program to work.
2. We then wrote the code for the program. We kept working on it and debugging it until it worked like intended.

#### What were the key concepts explored?
Working with Lists.

#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
Our results matched what we expected to get from the algorithm.

### Reflection
#### What challenge did you encounter?
It was tricky trying to figure out how to incrementally add numbers to the lists.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
Before coding, we created an algorithm, we made sure the code was readable by making variable names clear and including
comments, and we practiced for coding in this lab via the previous work we had with functions in lab 6.

We created an algorithm before coding, made sure that the code was readable by humans by making the variable names clear 
on what they did, and included comments, and we practiced for coding in this lab via the class notes we did on lists.

#### Did you overcome them and how?
We overcame the issue with the lists via debugging and referencing class notes to make sure how they worked.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
Working on this lab definitely helped me better understand how lists work and how to add to them.

#### What was it like working with your partner?
Working with Lucas went really well, he worked very efficiently and was very smart when it came to creating the algorithm.
