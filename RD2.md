#### Objective
* Create a program to display the distribution of rolls of two dice.
#### Procedure
* We understood the problem, then worked on identifying tasks, and used functions and while loops to solve the problem
* Lists, Functions, Loops, Random numbers
#### Results
* The results matched the expected
* I tried a bunch of numbers and potential errors with the code
#### Reflection
* I encountered the challenge of how to break down the problem into tasks
* I first understood the problem, came up with an algorithm and then tested with test cases
* I overcame my challenge by talking through the problem with Antonio
* I have a better understanding of functions and how to better use lists
* I think I learned what I was supposed to
* Working with my Antonio was good. He is smart and was easy to work with while working on the problem.
